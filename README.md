# Practice-It!
- A management system for teachers trying to optimize students' preparation for a big exam by tracking which questions they have completed, and from which topics. Ideal for an AP teacher who has a large question set to pull from and is allowing students to review in a self-paced fashion.

- Keeps track of all teachers, students, questions, and topics.

- Allows teachers to share questions with each other, while maintaining ownership of questions they have created.

- Uses bcrypt for password authentication.

## Development
- After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. You can run `rake console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Edit `db/seeds.rb` and then run `rake db:seed` to seed the database with your own data.
