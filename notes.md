Teacher can:
- log in
- log out
- create a new student (if logged in)
    - student associated with teacher
- create a new question (if logged in)
    - associate it with a new topic or an existing topic 
- create a new topic
- edit their own information 
- edit a student, a question, or a topic (from that student, question, or topic's show page)

- right now, all teachers can access all questions ... is that what I want?

Additional Features
- add checkboxes to Create Question form so teachers can select from existing topics (and then have a button to create a new topic as well?)
- a layout page! make it pretty...
- when teacher logs in they can select whether to view all students or view all questions
- when creating new teacher, if validation error --> recognize which field didn't validate correctly (and auto-populate others, perhaps?)
- confirm password 
- auto suggest usernmame (first_initial-dot-last_name-number)
- for students, validate uniqueness of first/last name combination
- teachers should really be able to share questions ... maybe questions get stored in some sort of global question bank?
