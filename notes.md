To do
- Teacher show page URL should be /teachers/:username instead of /teachers/:id

- Delete action for topics?
    * If a question was only associated with Topic X and then Topic X gets deleted, what should happen to the question?

- Do validations get checked when you update an object?

- Redirect for delete action? (Really, clean up all failures and worst-case redirects)

- Radio buttons for difficulty?

- Move index action to parent controller? What should index page look like? (Maybe a link to log in if user isn't logged in, otherwise link to teacher's show page)


Additional Features
- alphabetize topic list on teacher show page and topic index page
- import CSV files with topics and questions ("Question #1", etc.) and use to seed databases. Allow user to do the same!
- on question creation, allow teacher to create a new topic as well
- a layout page! make it pretty...
- when teacher logs in they can select whether to view all students or view all questions
- confirm password 
- auto suggest usernmame (first_initial-last_name-number)
- for students, validate uniqueness of first/last name combination
- ability to change password?
